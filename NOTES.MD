## üëÄ REVIEW <a name = 'review'></a>

- What happens when the user has set features and template but changes data
- What happens to a feature in template if it has been added to the template but deleted from the feature customization list

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES <a name = 'issues'></a>

- Ref on Template editor not returning Quill instance
- Based on above issue, inserting features in between template text is nearly impossible as cursor index cannot be determined (Lack of access to Quill instance === Lack of access to it's methods). Hence features can only be appended to temp0late text as a whole.
- Building a custom template editor will take forever and would definately involve a learning curve. Time consuming activities include design of the editor interface.

- What happens if the user wants to create a story with 2 different datasets that have different layout and field count.

## üí≠ SUGGESTIONS <a name = 'suggestions'></a>

- Get a new template library
